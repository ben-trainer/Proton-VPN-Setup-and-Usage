<h2>Lessons Learned </h2>
As expected what I learned was how simple it is to connect to a VPN and get straight to using it. It is an extremely fast and simple process. Connecting to an enterprise VPN may require a few extra steps, however, I believe it will be extremely straightforward as it wonâ€™t be very complex and would at most require a login and selecting the specific server.
